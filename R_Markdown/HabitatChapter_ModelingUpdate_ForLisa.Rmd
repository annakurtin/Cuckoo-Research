#### Research Question: What vegetation characteristics are associated with black-billed cuckoo (BBCU) habitat use at the western edge of this speciesâ€™ breeding range in Montana? 

#### Goal: exploratory/hypothesis generation since there are no formal studies in this region

#### Prediction: the following characteristics are important - vegetation structure, both in canopy and subcanopy complexity and height; density of woody vegetation, and vegetation species composition

For this chapter, I am creating an occupancy model using passive acoustic monitoring detections of BBCU in 2023 So far, I have been creating the process and state submodels separately, then I plan to combine them into a global model. My process/detection submodel has the following structure: 

$$
z_i \sim Bernoulli(\psi)
$$ 

$$
y_{ij} \sim Bernoulli(p| \beta_{date}, \beta_{date}^2,\beta_{avg db}, \beta_{effort})
$$

I am currently working on finding the best state/occupancy submodel. Andy, Erim, and I generated an a priori list of covariates that we believe affect BBCU occupancy:

* Percent canopy and subcanopy cover at a landscape scale (1 km radius around the monitoring point)

* Percent canopy and subcanopy cover at a core area within the home range scale (130 m radius around the monitoring point)

* Canopy height and subcanopy height at the core area scale

* Vertical complexity (measured by standard deviation) of subcanopy vegetation and all vegetation at the core area scale

* Native broadleaf tree species richness and dominant shrub community type at a point scale (from veg surveys conducted in an 11.3 m radius around the monitoring point)

Including separate covariates for each shrub community type, this is 13 covariates, which is too much to fit in a global model on our 107 sites of data. Additionally, there are several colinear covariates within this data. We decided to split the covariates up by scale and fit occupancy models on each of these submodels, then take the significant covariates from each submodel and combine into our global model. Hopefully this will reduce the number of covariates from 13 to 1 - 4 ish.

### Brief summary: Submodel C Core Area Scale

I have a couple different iterations of this model already, but I'll show you the original one I started with. We decided to only deal with the strong colinearity (R = .90) between total vegetation SD and canopy height. We did this by using the residual variation in SD regressed against height instead of the original covariate. This way  so that we could see the unique contribution of the additional variation in veg complexity. 

Covariates included:

* **a1:** Percent canopy cover

* **a2:** Percent subcanopy cover

* **a3:** Canopy height 

* **a4:** Subcanopy height

* **a5:** subcanopy standard deviation

* **a6:** total vegetation standard deivation residual variation from regression with canopy height

After seeing these results, I mapped out colinearity relationships greater than R = .6 and created more residual variables to try to pick apart the importance of the total value of the covariate vs each of their unique contribution. I'd love to talk through a bit the process for picking apart these relationships and deciding how to account for them in models.

### Questions:

* What is the best way to address colinearity within models like this?

* What is the best way to pare down the number of covariates in a model?

* What is the best way of assessing goodness of fit when creating sub models like this?
