############Visualizing and Training Acoustic Data in R ######################

# This is a script to test out creating an R script to train people to extract cuckoo data for the training data
# This is to get them familiar with what cuckoo calls are like and how to identify them from similar confusion species

# Calls: BBCU and YBCU of all call types (see notes on tablet)
# Confusion species: yellow breasted chat, dove, catbird (?)
