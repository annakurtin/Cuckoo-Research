This is the first iteration of the poisson model I will be using to test strength of habitat use across sites. I will be looking at number of days with a cuckoo vocalization at only the sites with cuckoo presence (so that I don't have to account for detection) and only the habitat covariates from my global occupancy model on habitat use. 

#### Model structure
$$
\theta \sim Poisson(\gamma_0 + \gamma_{cov1} + \gamma_{covn})
$$
