This is the twelfth iteration of the linear model I will be using to test strength of habitat use across sites. Using the gamma-poisson distribution to parameterize the response variable to account for not only how many days with calling but also how many days there are for each site. Trying to include all of the data including the zeros and all of the covariates of interest. Only looking at data from the period between July 1st and July 15th so that standardizing effort, adding in covariate for the number of days recorded at a site.

### Model structure:

$$ c_i \sim Poisson(\gamma_i * h_i) $$

$$ h_i \sim Gamma(\theta,\theta) $$

$$ \theta \sim Gamma(1, 1) $$

$$ log(\gamma_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * cov1 + \beta_2 * cov2 + \beta_3 * cov3 + \beta_4 * cov4 +\beta_4 * cov5 $$

$$ c_i: \text{Number of calls at a site}$$

$$ \beta_1: \text{Percent canopy cover at lanscape scale}$$

$$ \beta_2: \text{Percent shrub/early successional cover at landscape scale} $$

$$ \beta_3: \text{Vegetation sd residuals at core area scale} $$

$$ \beta_4: \text{Percent shrub/early successional cover at core area scale} $$
$$ \beta_5: \text{Combined days of recording}$$
**Handling of NAs (only occur in habitat covs):** Imputation for habitat covariates (sites with no LiDAR data), no missing data for call counts

### Interpreting output:

**Strongly significant covariates (F statistic > 0.90):** 

* Vegetation complexity: We have no evidence that the effect of vegetation complexity on intensity of use is negative ( F = 1). The median estimate for the effect of vegetation complexity on intensity of use of the site is 0.35, which means that at the mean values of the other covariates, for every 1 sd increase in vegetation complexity above the mean (.83 increase over mean of 0), the number of calls at a site increases by .35. 

* Recording days at site: We have no evidence that the effect of the cumulative number of days recorded by all ARUs at the site is negative (F = .99). The median estimate for the effect of recording days on intensity of the use of the site is 0.29, which means that for every 1 sd increase in the cumulative days recorded at the site (13 days increase over 24.6 days or the addition of approximately one more ARU), the number of calls at a site increases by .29.
*How do we know when we have all of the potential calls?* 

* Percent Shrub/Early Successional Cover at Landscape Scale: We are 96% sure that the true effect of shrub/early successional cover on intensity of use is negative (F = .96). The median estimate for the effect of shrub/early succesional cover at the landscape scale on intensity of use is 0.081, which means that for every 1 sd increase in the percent cover (7.4% increase over mean of 14.5%), the number of calls at a site decreases by .081.

* Percent Shrub/Early Successional Cover at Core Scale: We are 93% sure that the true effect of shrub/early successional cover at the core scale on intensity of use is negative (F = .93). The median estimate for the effect of shrub/early successional cover at the core scale on intensity of use is 0.081, which means that for every 1 sd increase in the percent cover over the mean (11.0% increase over mean of 18.4%), the number of calls at a site decreases by .081. 

**Weakly significant covariates (0.70 < F < 0.90):**

* Percent canopy cover at landscape scale: We are 76% sure that the true effect of percent canopy cover at the landscape scale on intensity of use is positive (F = .76). The median estimate for the effect of canopy cover at the landsdcape scale is 0.185, which means that for every 1 sd increase in canopy cover above the mean (6.8% increase over mean of 8.6%), the number of calls at a site increases by 0.185.


**Lingering thoughts and questions:**

* What does posterior intercept of -1.71 mean? plogis this gives us 0.15. This seems very low but is because we only had 23 days with calls and 110 sites without calls, so our "average" per site is going to be very small. 

* Do I need to scale my response variable as well? I don't think so.
