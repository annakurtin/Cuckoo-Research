title: 'Occupancy Sub Model C6: Core Scale Covariates'

This is the ongoing iteration of the core home range (130 m radius of points) scale submodel within the occupancy/state submodel, after selecting which covariates to combine and which to include (see habitat modeling notes and progress in OneNote). This is the same model structure as model 5 but I removed canopy height and replaced veg sd residuals with the original value

#### Model structure:

State model with four covariates: percent subcanopy (cova1),  height of subcanopy (cova2), height of canopy (cova3), and standard deviation of all veg residuals from regression with canopy height (cov4)

$$
z_i \sim Bernoulli(\psi | \alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}, \alpha_{3}, \alpha_{4})
$$ 

Process model with four covariates:  

$$
y_{ij} \sim Bernoulli(p| \beta_{date}, \beta_{date}^2,\beta_{avg db}, \beta_{effort})
$$

**Handling of NAs:** omission for detections, imputation for habitat covariates
